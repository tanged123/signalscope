name: agtx:execute
description: Execute an approved implementation plan. Implement the changes, then write a summary to .agtx/execute.md and stop.

# Execution Phase

You are in the **execution phase** of an agtx-managed task.

## Input

The argument to this command is a task ID.

If `.agtx/plan.md` exists in the current working directory, read it — it already contains the approved plan and all needed context. Do NOT call `get_task`.

If `.agtx/plan.md` does not exist, fetch the task description:

```
mcp__agtx__get_task(task_id: "<the id passed to this command>")
```

## Instructions

1. Read `.agtx/plan.md` if it exists (skip `get_task`), otherwise fetch via `get_task`
2. Implement the changes
3. Run relevant tests to verify your changes
4. Fix any issues found during testing

## Output

When implementation is complete, write a summary to `.agtx/execute.md` in the **current working directory** with these sections:

## Changes

What files were modified/created and what was changed in each.

## Testing

How you verified the changes — tests run, results, manual checks.

## CRITICAL: Stop After Writing

After writing `.agtx/execute.md` (in the current working directory):

- Do NOT start new work beyond the plan
- Say: "Implementation complete. Summary written to `.agtx/execute.md`."
- Wait for further instructions
